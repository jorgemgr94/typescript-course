/**
A binary search tree, is a binary tree where the nodes are ordered in a specific way.
For each node, all the nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value,
and all the nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
This ordering makes it easier to search for nodes with specific values, which is why it's
called a "search" tree.
